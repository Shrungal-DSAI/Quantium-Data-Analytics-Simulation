# Quantium Data Analytics Simulation 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a data analytics simulation by **Quantium**, focusing on customer segmentation and sales trends in the chips industry. We analyze transaction data to extract key insights about customer behavior, product sales, and marketing effectiveness.

## 📊 Datasets Used
The following datasets were used:
- **Transaction Data:** Includes purchase details such as date, store number, loyalty card number, and total sales.
- **Customer Data:** Contains customer lifestage and premium status.
- **Product Data:** Information about chip products purchased.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Sales Trends Over Time by Customer Lifestage**  
   - Visualizing total sales by customer lifestage over time to identify sales peaks and trends.
2. **Average Transaction Value by Customer Type**  
   - Analyzing spending behavior among different customer categories (Premium, Mainstream, Budget).
3. **Sales Distribution: Premium vs Non-Premium Customers**  
   - Understanding the proportion of sales driven by premium vs non-premium customers.
4. **Customer Segmentation Analysis**  
   - Categorizing customers based on lifestage and premium status to refine marketing strategies.
